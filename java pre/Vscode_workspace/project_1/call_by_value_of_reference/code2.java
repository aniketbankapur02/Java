    // game1 = game2;           // `game1` now points to the object that `game2` references
    // game2 = temp;            // `game2` now points to the object that `temp` references

    // This only changes the references within this method; the original objects remain unchanged in the heap.
    // Printing locally would show the swapped references, but it would not affect the objects outside this method.

    // Changes are only universally reflected if we modify the actual object in the heap.
    // To truly swap, we need to access and modify the objectâ€™s fields, not just the references.

    // Example:
    // Game temp = game1;                // `temp` now holds the reference code of `game1` (ageOfEmpires), so all point to obj1
    // game1.gameType = game2.gameType;  // Access obj1 (STRATEGY) and change it to RPG
    // game2.gameType = temp.gameType;   // Access obj2 (RPG) and change it to STRATEGY as `temp` still refers to STRATEGY

    // The above does not work as expected in a true "swap" because it only involves two objects.
    // To implement a 3-variable swap, we need a third object to temporarily store values for swapping.
    
    
    Game temp2 = new Game(null);            // Creating a new object `temp2` in the heap; null is used initially because the constructor requires a value
    temp2.gameType = game1.gameType;        // `temp2` (obj3) now temporarily holds STRATEGY
    game1.gameType = game2.gameType;        // `game1` (obj1) now holds RPG, effectively changing obj1 to RPG
    game2.gameType = temp2.gameType;        // `game2` (obj2) now holds STRATEGY as copied from obj3
    

    // Instead of creating a new object, we can simplify by using a temporary storage variable of type GameType:
    
    GameType temp3 = game1.gameType;         // Temporarily store STRATEGY in `temp3`
    game1.gameType = game2.gameType;         // Change obj1 to RPG
    game2.gameType = temp3;                  // Change obj2 to STRATEGY using `temp3`'s stored value

    // Note: Here, the references of `game1` and `game2` themselves are not swapped.
    // Instead, we accessed the objects they point to and modified the actual data in the heap.

    // If `gameType` were private, you could use getter and setter methods to access and modify it.
