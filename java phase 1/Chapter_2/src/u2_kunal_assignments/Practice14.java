 Program to find the Depreciation of Value
Last Updated : 28 May, 2022
The value of any article or item subject to wear and tear, decreases with time. This decrease is called its Depreciation. Given three variable V1, R and T where V1 is the initial value, R is the rate of depreciation and T is the time in years. The task is to find the value of the item after T years.
Examples: 
 


Input: V1 = 200, R = 10, T = 2 
Output: 162
Input: V1 = 560, R = 5, T = 3 
Output: 480.13
