         * Ans----------insterally when you write enum class bec of this = new
         * Week("Monday", 0); as it has constructor and it is static in nature static
         * are initialized during class load time so all constants from mon to sun are
         * inilized during class load time and yes due to this all constructor are all
         * called during class load time
         * during class load before constructor call all static is initialized
         * so what happens is we are calling constructor for each constants during class
         * load time
         * as enum constants are static in nature so all constructor are called during
         * class load to initialize all constants

/*-----------------notes 1
 * explain me in detail enum constructor concept why it is printing all objects
 * 
 * 
 * ChatGPT said:
 * Absolutely Aniket! Let‚Äôs dive deep into the enum constructor concept and
 * understand why all enum constants are printed with the constructor message,
 * even when you're not explicitly creating them.
 * 
 * üß© Step-by-Step Breakdown: Enum in Java
 * Let's take your code and understand every part of what‚Äôs going on.
 * 
 * ‚úÖ What is an Enum?
 * In Java:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * enum Week {
 * Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday;
 * }
 * enum is a special class that represents a fixed set of constants.
 * 
 * Each of Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday is a constant object (an instance of
 * Week).
 * 
 * These constants are implicitly public static final, and they are created
 * automatically by the JVM when the class is loaded.
 * 
 * üì¶ Under the Hood: What Does Java Do with Enum?
 * The compiler roughly converts this:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * enum Week {
 * Monday, Tuesday;
 * }
 * Into something like:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * class Week extends Enum<Week> {
 * public static final Week Monday = new Week("Monday", 0);
 * public static final Week Tuesday = new Week("Tuesday", 1);
 * 
 * private Week(String name, int ordinal) {
 * super(name, ordinal);
 * // your custom code if any
 * }
 * }
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è You can't see or change this because Java handles it automatically.
 * 
 * üí° Enum Constructor
 * In your code:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * enum Week {
 * Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday;
 * 
 * Week() {
 * System.out.println("Constructor called for " + this);
 * }
 * }
 * You're defining a custom no-argument constructor. Here's what happens:
 * 
 * When your program starts and accesses any constant (e.g. Week.Monday), Java
 * loads the Week enum class.
 * 
 * Java creates all enum constants in the order they're defined.
 * 
 * While doing that, Java calls the constructor for each constant, exactly once.
 * 
 * ‚úÖ So:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * Week.Monday -> constructor called
 * Week.Tuesday -> constructor called
 * ...
 * Even if you only use Week.Monday in your code, the JVM creates all constants
 * up front when the class is loaded.
 * 
 * üîÅ When is the Constructor Called?
 * Once per constant
 * 
 * Before the main() method starts
 * 
 * Executed automatically by JVM
 * 
 * So this:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * System.out.println("Constructor called for " + this);
 * Will execute 7 times ‚Äì once for each enum value (Monday to Sunday) ‚Äî even if
 * you don't use all the constants.
 * 
 * üìå Why Is This Happening?
 * Because enum constants are static final instances, they are initialized at
 * class-loading time, not at runtime when you access them.
 * 
 * Even if you only call Week.Monday, all constants are already initialized, so
 * all their constructors run.
 * 
 * Java doesn‚Äôt load Week.Monday separately ‚Äî it loads the whole Week class and
 * builds all constants in one go.
 * 
 * üß† Analogy
 * Think of enum as a bakery menu:
 * 
 * You define the full menu (Monday to Sunday).
 * 
 * The moment you enter the shop (run your program and access any item), the
 * shop prepares all items on the menu.
 * 
 * Even if you only buy a donut (Monday), the baker had already baked all the
 * items.
 * 
 * üìå Output You See
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * Constructor called for Monday
 * Constructor called for Tuesday
 * Constructor called for Wednesday
 * Constructor called for Thursday
 * Constructor called for Friday
 * Constructor called for Saturday
 * Constructor called for Sunday
 * This happens before you start printing or looping in your main() method ‚Äî
 * because enum constants are created during class loading.
 * 
 * üìò Bonus: ordinal() and values()
 * ordinal() returns the position of the constant (0-based index).
 * 
 * values() gives an array of all constants in the order they are declared.
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * Week.Monday.ordinal(); // 0
 * Week.Tuesday.ordinal(); // 1
 * ‚úÖ Final Summary:
 * Concept Explanation
 * Enum constants Are objects of the enum class
 * Constructor Runs once for each constant when class is loaded
 * Why all printed? JVM creates all constants eagerly, even if you use only one
 * this in constructor Refers to the current enum constant being created
 * When does it run? Before main() runs, during class loading

 * 
 * ChatGPT said:
 * Great follow-up, Aniket! You're asking a very deep and important question
 * that many Java learners wonder about when working with enum.
 * 
 * Let‚Äôs explore:
 * 
 * üîç Your Doubt:
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * Week() {
 * System.out.println("Constructor called for " + this);
 * }
 * 
 * // this is not public or protected, only private or default
 * // why? we don't want to create new objects
 * // this is not the enum concept, that's why
 * You're asking:
 * Why can't the constructor of an enum be public or protected? Why is it
 * private or package-private (default) only?
 * 
 * Let‚Äôs break it down fully.
 * 
 * üí° Enum Constructor: Visibility and Restriction
 * ‚úÖ Enum Constants are Predefined
 * In this enum:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * enum Week {
 * Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday;
 * }
 * The constants Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are created by the JVM at compile
 * time, and instantiated automatically.
 * 
 * You do not create them using new Week() anywhere in your code.
 * 
 * Java does this internally, safely and in a controlled way.
 * 
 * ‚ùå You Cannot Do This:
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * Week day = new Week(); // ‚ùå Illegal
 * This line won‚Äôt compile. Why?
 * 
 * Because Java forbids enum instantiation using new. Why?
 * 
 * ‚ùó Enum = Fixed, Singleton-like Instances
 * Enums represent a finite, fixed set of constants.
 * You shouldn‚Äôt be able to create more enum values than declared.
 * 
 * If enum constructors were public or protected, someone might try to do:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * Week custom = new Week(); // Illegal
 * That would break the whole purpose of enum ‚Äî fixed values only!
 * 
 * üí¨ So Why private or default?
 * Because it ensures that:
 * 
 * Modifier Meaning
 * private Constructor can be used only inside enum class itself. Only Java
 * internals use it to create enum constants. ‚úÖ Best practice.
 * default (no keyword) Means package-private. Also okay, but not typically used
 * unless needed internally in the package.
 * public or protected ‚ùå Not allowed. Would open the door to external
 * instantiation, breaking enum integrity.
 * ‚úÖ Compiler Enforces This
 * If you write:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * public Week() { ... } // ‚ùå Compiler error
 * You‚Äôll get:
 * 
 * cpp
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * modifier public not allowed here
 * Because Java restricts the constructor from being visible outside the enum ‚Äî
 * to enforce safety and integrity.
 * 
 * üì¶ How Are Enum Constants Created Then?
 * When the JVM loads your enum:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * enum Week {
 * Monday, Tuesday;
 * 
 * Week() {
 * System.out.println("Constructor called for " + this);
 * }
 * }
 * Java automatically does:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * Week Monday = new Week("Monday", 0);
 * Week Tuesday = new Week("Tuesday", 1);
 * Even though you never wrote this!
 * 
 * And these objects are stored in the enum class as:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * public static final Week Monday = ...;
 * üß† Final Summary
 * Concept Explanation
 * Why is the constructor private/default? To prevent external object creation
 * Who calls the constructor? JVM automatically calls it for each constant
 * Can we write new Week()? ‚ùå No ‚Äî compiler forbids it
 * Can we make constructor public or protected? ‚ùå No ‚Äî it defeats enum purpose
 * Enum objects Are singleton-like, constant, final
 * Enum purpose Represent fixed number of known instances only
