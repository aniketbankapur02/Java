1)encapsulation and abstraction with code implementation

1. Encapsulation
Definition:
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on the data into a single unit (a class) and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components. This is done using access modifiers (like private, public) and getters/setters.

Purpose:

Protect the internal state of an object.

Control how data is accessed or modified.

Avoid unintended side effects.

Example: Encapsulation in Code
java
Copy
public class BankAccount {
    // Private data (encapsulated)
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    // Public constructor
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public methods to interact with private data (controlled access)
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount);
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrawn: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid withdrawal amount");
        }
    }

    // Getter for balance (read-only access)
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // No setter for balance (direct modification is restricted)
}
Usage:

java
Copy
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456", 1000);
        account.deposit(500); // Valid
        account.withdraw(200); // Valid
        // account.balance = 100000; // Error: 'balance' is private
        System.out.println("Current balance: $" + account.getBalance());
    }
}
Key Points:

balance and accountNumber are private and cannot be directly accessed outside the class.

Controlled access is provided via methods like deposit() and withdraw().

The internal logic (e.g., validating withdrawal amounts) is hidden from the user.

2. Abstraction
Definition:
Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features. It simplifies interaction with a system by providing a high-level interface (e.g., abstract classes, interfaces).

Purpose:

Reduce complexity by hiding internal details.

Define a clear contract for how to interact with a class/component.

Example: Abstraction in Code
java
Copy
// Abstract class (defines a template)
abstract class Vehicle {
    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    public abstract void start();

    // Concrete method (implementation provided)
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped.");
    }
}

// Concrete class implementing the abstraction
class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started with a key.");
    }
}

// Another concrete class
class ElectricCar extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Electric car started via app.");
    }
}
Usage:

java
Copy
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        Vehicle eCar = new ElectricCar();

        car.start();    // Output: "Car started with a key."
        eCar.start();   // Output: "Electric car started via app."
        eCar.stop();    // Output: "Vehicle stopped."
    }
}
Key Points:

The Vehicle abstract class defines a contract (the start() method).

Implementation details of start() are hidden in subclasses (Car, ElectricCar).

Users interact with the abstraction (Vehicle) without worrying about internal logic.

Encapsulation vs. Abstraction
Aspect	Encapsulation	Abstraction
Focus	Data hiding and access control.	Hiding complexity, showing essentials.
Implementation	Uses private fields and getters/setters.	Uses abstract classes, interfaces.
Purpose	Protect data integrity.	Simplify interaction with a system.
Example	private variables in a BankAccount.	Vehicle abstract class with start().
Real-World Analogy
Encapsulation: A vending machine. You don’t see its internal mechanics, but you interact via buttons (methods) to get a snack.

Abstraction: A car’s steering wheel. You don’t need to know how the engine works to drive it.


2)difference between encapsulation and abstraction

Encapsulation vs. Abstraction: Key Differences
Aspect	Encapsulation	Abstraction
Definition	Bundling data and methods into a class, hiding internal details.	Hiding complexity by exposing only essential features.
Purpose	Protect data integrity and control access.	Simplify interaction with a system by focusing on "what" it does, not "how".
Implementation	Uses private fields and public getters/setters.	Uses abstract classes, interfaces, or method signatures.
Focus	Data hiding: Restricting direct access to data.	Complexity hiding: Ignoring unnecessary details.
Real-World Analogy	A pill (capsule) hiding medicine inside.	A car’s steering wheel (you drive without knowing engine details).
Code Example	private variables with controlled access via methods.	Abstract classes defining a template (e.g., Animal with sound()).
1. Encapsulation in Action
What it does:

Protects data by making fields private and exposing controlled access via methods (e.g., getName(), setName()).

Ensures data validation (e.g., preventing negative values for an account balance).

Example:

java
Copy
public class Student {
    private String name; // Encapsulated field
    private int age;

    // Getter (read access)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter (write access with validation)
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age!");
        }
    }
}
Why use it:

Prevents external code from modifying data in invalid ways (e.g., setting age = -30).

Allows internal logic to change without breaking external code.

2. Abstraction in Action
What it does:

Defines a simplified interface for complex operations (e.g., a start() method for a vehicle).

Lets users interact with high-level concepts without worrying about implementation.

Example:

java
Copy
// Abstract class (defines "what" to do)
abstract class PaymentGateway {
    public abstract void processPayment(double amount); // Abstract method (no implementation)
}

// Concrete class (defines "how" to do it)
class PayPalGateway extends PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing $" + amount + " via PayPal.");
        // Hidden logic: API calls, encryption, etc.
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentGateway gateway = new PayPalGateway();
        gateway.processPayment(100); // User only cares about paying, not the implementation.
    }
}
Why use it:

Users interact with PaymentGateway without knowing how PayPal or Stripe work internally.

You can switch payment providers without changing the user’s code.

Key Takeaways
Encapsulation is about protecting data (e.g., using private variables and getters/setters).
Example: A bank account balance that can’t be directly modified.

Abstraction is about simplifying complexity (e.g., using abstract classes/interfaces).
Example: A sendEmail() method where you don’t care about SMTP server details.

Together: Encapsulation hides data, while abstraction hides implementation. Both make code modular, secure, and easier to maintain.
