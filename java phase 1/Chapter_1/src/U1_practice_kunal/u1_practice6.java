 Check if a String is a Palindrome
Problem Statement:

Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. Ignore non-alphanumeric characters and consider case insensitivity.

Example 1:

Copy
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: After removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, the string becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama", which is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Copy
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: After removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, the string becomes "raceacar", which is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Copy
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: An empty string is considered a palindrome.
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5

s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
