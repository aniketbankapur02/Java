You are tasked with designing the application for getting information for the Movies and actors working in the said movie.

Consider the following classes for the Movies:

Movies:

movield: int

movieName: String

movieRating: int

numberOfActor: int

actors: List<String>

Make getter, setter and constructor for the Movie class.

There should be 2 non static method that needs to be created in the MovieService Class as mentioned below:

Task 1: Fetch List of Movies Based on the Actor:

Create a non static method which will find out the list of movies, in which specific actor. has worked.

This method will take two input: List<Movie> movies and String actorName.

In case there are no movies with aforementioned actor Name print "No Movies Found" in Movie Tester.

This method will return the List of Movies with the mentioned actorName.

This list must be printed in the main method. Please investigate the Sample input and output for the better understanding of the program.

Task 2: Calculate Average Movie Rating based on the Actor:

Create a non static method which will assist in getting the average movie rating for the specific actor.

This method will take two inputs: List<Movie> movies and String actorName.

In case there are no movies with aforementioned actorName throw NoActor FoundException with the message "No Actor Found" from the MovieService class.

This method will return double averageRating of movies with the mentioned actorName.

This averageRating of movies must be printed in the main method. Please investigate the Sample input and output for the better understanding of the program.

Note:

Write the code for accepting inputs, printing outputs and calling the non-static methods in the main method from the MovieService class.

You can refer to the sample input/output below to verify your solution.

Don't use any static test or formatting for printing the result. Just invoke the methods and print the result.

All comparisons should be case-insensitive.
